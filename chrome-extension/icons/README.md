# Icon Placeholder Files

Since this is a text-based environment, I cannot create actual PNG icon files. 
You'll need to create the following icon files:

- `icon-16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon-32.png` (32x32 pixels) 
- `icon-48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon-128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Icon Design Suggestions

The icons should represent stock/financial themes, such as:
- ðŸ“ˆ A simple chart with an upward trend
- ðŸ’¹ A stock ticker symbol
- ðŸ“Š A bar chart or graph
- ðŸŽ¯ A target with financial symbols

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
1. **Online tools**: favicon.io, canva.com, or figma.com
2. **Design software**: Photoshop, GIMP, or Sketch
3. **SVG to PNG converters**: For scalable vector graphics

## Temporary Solution

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Download any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files
2. Rename them to match the required filenames
3. Place them in this `icons/` directory

The extension will work without proper icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.
